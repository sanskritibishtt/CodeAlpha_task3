Handwritten Character Recognition
TASK 3:
 CNN Model for Handwritten Character Recognition
This Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is designed to recognize handwritten characters using grayscale images. The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, which help in extracting spatial features from the input images. The final layers include dense (fully connected) layers with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, and it is trained for 20 epochs.

Key steps in the process include:

Data Preprocessing:

Images are resized to 64x64 pixels and normalized to have values between 0 and 1.
Labels are encoded into numerical format and one-hot encoded for multi-class classification.
Model Training:

The model was trained using a split of the dataset into training and testing sets, with validation accuracy tracked throughout the training process.
Model Evaluation:

The model achieved a certain level of accuracy on the test set, which was measured using a confusion matrix and classification report.
Visualizations were generated to understand the model's performance, including plotting accuracy over epochs and displaying a confusion matrix.
Error Analysis:

Misclassified images were plotted to analyze where the model struggled, along with correctly classified examples to understand the model's strengths.
The model was saved in a .keras format for future use, and the trained weights can be loaded back for inference or further fine-tuning. Overall, the model provides a strong baseline for handwritten character recognition tasks, and the visualizations help in understanding its performance and areas for improvement.
